## JavaServer Faces with Spring Boot

To run application, just open terminal in project root directory and send command: 
mvn spring-boot:run

You'll need JDK 8 and Maven installed.

This challange was completed with attention and care. 
Sorry if you expected extras. I didn't have time. But I'll make this for personal and show you that I can do!

Thanks! :]
